Programmable_Security_Assessment_&_Vulnerabilities_Verification_System (PSAVVY) framework designed for Recon, vulnerabilities scanning and exploitation. It features a comprehensive list of Python3 Lambda Functions, equipped with terminal commands, allowing for targeted scanning and autonomous exploitation. Pronounce as SAVVY.

YOU LOVE ONELINERs, YOU KNOW HOW THE ONELINERs WORKS AND YOU LOVE AUTOMATION IN BUGBOUNTY AND PENTESTING THIS TOOL IS FOR YOUâ€¦ It is your personal automation container script.

**USAGE:
**

sudo python3 psavvy.py -d target.com



**IMP NOTICE:
**
TOOLS TO DOWNLOAD
The project in Beta mode, and Github does not allow the large file upload, for free accounts.
Here is the link of Tools Folder, you can download it  and extract it in your psavvy folder. Enjoy the Tools
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Adzk542Q96RjybP3K891kP8_oUneS79-/view?usp=sharing

In Coming future you will see the installation scripts....

If you know the python3 and you are familiar with Linux OS, you are beginner or intermediate programmer; you can modify it and make it your own PSAVVY. This program is that flexible.
Note: 
Open the psavvy.py file and understand the program flow.
The Project is in Beta Mode, Hope many researcher will like it. And you will get more new future Updates.

**Why I made PSAVVY?
**

The programs available online they are bulky and if you make changes in them the code get break and it is become so frustrated to patch the code of Tool and run them. Thatâ€™s why in PSAVVY you find only one psavvy.py file in which you can do whatever you like..

**Comment the line in psavvy.py file you donâ€™t want to use or tools and uncomment them whenever you need them.
**

Why I used the lambda Function.
The python3 lambda Function is loveâ€¦ Thatâ€™s whyâ€¦..If you open psavvy.py you will the find list of lambda function, anyone can edit and modify the program, make their own a vulnerabilities scanner and exploitation tool.
If you want to modify the program, before that please readâ€¦

https://realpython.com/python-lambda/#:~:text=The%20Python%20lambda%20function%20could,n%20set%20at%20definition%20time.

**Importance of Python3 lambda function in project
**

**Normal Function Declaration..
**

Normal functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function's name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and a colon. The body of the function is indented below the declaration. These functions can contain multiple expressions and statements, including loops and conditionals.

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
	
**Lambda Function Declaration..
**


Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. You can have any number of parameters, but only one expression, the result of which is returned by the function.

add_numbers = lambda a, b: a + b

Advantages of Using Lambda Functions
1.	Conciseness: Lambda functions allow you to write functions compactly, reducing the amount of code. They eliminate the need for defining a function with def and naming it, which is especially useful for small, one-off functions that won't be reused.
2.	Inline Definition: Lambda functions can be defined inline, which is handy when passing a simple function as an argument to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), such as map(), filter(), and sorted().
3.	Functionality: In contexts where functions are used as syntactical constructs (e.g., in key functions for sorting or for temporary use in higher-order functions), lambda functions can simplify the code by embedding the function definition directly into the code that uses it.
4.	Readability: For simple operations, using lambda functions can improve readability. When used appropriately, they make it immediately clear that the function is a simple, short operation that won't be used elsewhere.

**Code Structure of PSAVVY.

**Do not forget to add the comma , (after every new command you add). Shown above.
**
If you want to add some functionalities and Commands to psavvy.py file. Follow the below rules and add them.

****Syntax:**
**
![image](https://github.com/DeepakGhengat/psavvy/assets/50538177/7327f527-a61b-4a49-a418-8d05d5e9a32a)


**Note**: The tools lies in the $Tools Directory If you want add some extra tools operations remember the directory structure then add the commands. Add your new Tool into the $Tools Directory, Make a Linux terminal Tool based command you want.

**Note:** "{domain}" is a placeholder for the website address (e.g., xyz.com), if we create specific linux terminal based tool commands, add them in lambda function in psavvy.py program file.

for eg: (bash Tools/SubEnum/subenum.sh -d {domain} -r â€“p).

To save the output we have the $output directory you can use the Linux basics terminal and add your text file in the $output directory with a name you like.
**for eg:**
![image](https://github.com/DeepakGhengat/psavvy/assets/50538177/14f23f95-d18d-43ea-a6e2-4a3461bbf8e7)

**Config.txt:**

Replace your urls in the config file DO NOT FORGET.

BURP_COLLAB_URL=https://webhook.site/42d36503-e6c7-4a06-a290-5b0bc6d6f64a

BLIND_XSS_URL=https://webhook.site/42d36503-e6c7-4a06-a290-5b0bc6d6f64a

you can declare the variable name in the config.txt file you want to use, you can give any name to the variable you want, and declare it in your tools commands in program (psavvy.py) if needed, as shown below.

For eg:
![image](https://github.com/DeepakGhengat/psavvy/assets/50538177/27a1d77d-357a-4f06-8986-b446fa396291)

If you can see the declaration {get_url_from_config(args.config, 'BURP_COLLAB_URL')}.
you can use the syntax {get_url_from_config(args.config, VARIABLE NAME)}. And declare with any tools you want and if they required the parameter of like that or use as linux terminal command of Tools for eg: ssrf.py -d xyz.com -b BURPCOLLABORATOR_ADDRESS and copy paste in the lambda execute_command function as shown above. Please try to run the psavvy.py file with all the recon tools after all the subdomains and results get collected which is the essential part to run the container, after that you can comment others Lines and  check the specific Vulnerability scanner and Exploitation Tools.

**Note:
**

**Pre installation needed:
**
Checks the Program Flow if you think Tools binaries not installed on the OS please install them. Other Tools you can find on the $Tools/ Directory. Auto
Installation may be available in future version.

Wordlist:
You can make a changes in the wordlists like Add new payloads, new words, and new DNS resolver, Do not rename the wordlists.

** OS Support:
**
Only Linux for Now(But if you are really a hacker you can modify psavvy.py file for your operating system).

If you are facing any problem, please mention them in issues section.

Thanks to All Cybersecurity Researcher, Big Inspiration for Project ðŸ’–
